///   batch. The [#NO_NULLS] singleton, returned for the no-nulls fast
///   path; no per-batch allocation.
/// - **Backed** — a packed `long[]` bitmap with **set-bit = present**
///   polarity: bit `i` is set iff item `i` is present (non-null). Word
///   `w` covers items `[w*64, w*64+64)`, low bit = lowest item.
///
/// Consumer-side predicates (`isNull(i)` / `isNotNull(i)` / `hasNulls()`)
/// describe nullability; the storage uses set-bit = present internally
/// to match Arrow's layout. [#hasNulls()] makes the no-nulls fast path
