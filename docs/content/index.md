# Hardwood

_A lightweight Java reader for the [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) file format.
Available as a Java library and a [command-line tool](reference/cli.md)._

## Why Hardwood

Hardwood gives applications Parquet read support without pulling in Hadoop, Avro, or the wider [parquet-java](https://github.com/apache/parquet-java) dependency tree:

* **Light-weight** — zero transitive dependencies beyond optional compression libraries (Snappy, ZSTD, LZ4, Brotli).
* **Compatible** — reads every file that `parquet-java` reads, with documented divergences where Hardwood applies stricter semantics (e.g. SQL three-valued `notEq`).
* **Fast** — matches or exceeds `parquet-java`'s read throughput; competitive in native-image builds and short-lived JVMs.
* **Concurrent** — multi-threaded at the core: pages decode in parallel on a shared thread pool, with cross-file prefetching for multi-file reads.
* **Embeddable** — usable from native CLIs, S3-only pipelines (without `hadoop-aws`), and Avro / Spark consumers via thin shim modules, including a [drop-in `parquet-java` replacement](how-to/compat.md).

## Quick Example

```java
import dev.hardwood.InputFile;
import dev.hardwood.reader.ParquetFileReader;
import dev.hardwood.reader.RowReader;

try (ParquetFileReader fileReader = ParquetFileReader.open(InputFile.of(path));
    RowReader rowReader = fileReader.rowReader()) {

    while (rowReader.hasNext()) {
        rowReader.next();

        long id = rowReader.getLong("id");
        String name = rowReader.getString("name");
        LocalDate birthDate = rowReader.getDate("birth_date");
        Instant createdAt = rowReader.getTimestamp("created_at");
    }
}
```

## Status

This is Beta quality software, under active development.

Reading from S3 or an in-memory `ByteBuffer` currently caps a file at 2 GB; split larger datasets across multiple files (local memory-mapped reads have no whole-file size limit). See [Parquet file layout](concepts/parquet-layout.md).

## Roadmap

Forward-looking items tracked for post-1.0. None are committed to a specific release.

- **Finalize `ColumnReader` API** — stabilize the API for columnar access and move it out of "Experimental" state. ([#522](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/522))
- **Writer support** — write Parquet files in addition to reading; today Hardwood is reader-only. ([#9](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/9))
- **Bloom filter predicate pushdown** — use per-chunk bloom filters for equality-predicate skipping on high-cardinality columns, where min/max statistics can't help. ([#105](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/105))
- **Parquet Modular Encryption** — read files encrypted under the Parquet [Modular Encryption spec](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/Encryption.md): encrypted footer, per-column keys, AES-GCM and AES-GCM-CTR. ([#128](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/128))
- **Apache Arrow interop** — `ColumnReader` output as Arrow `FieldVector` / `VectorSchemaRoot` for zero-copy handoff to DuckDB, DataFusion, Pandas-via-JNI, and other Arrow-native consumers. ([#153](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/issues/153))
