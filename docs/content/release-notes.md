# Release Notes

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/releases) for downloads and more information.

## 1.0.0.CR2 (unreleased)

<!-- TODO at release: add the announcement blog post link here, as a follow-up commit (see CR1).  · [API changes](/api-changes/1.0.0.CR2/) -->

Highlights of this release:

- **Breaking:** `RowReaderBuilder.firstRow()` renamed to `skip()`, which now composes with a filter as a logical `OFFSET` — rows are skipped after the filter is applied
- Configurable read batch size for `ColumnReader` / `ColumnReaders`, with the default batch size now part of the public API
- TIMESTAMP accessors honor `isAdjustedToUTC`, with dedicated accessors for local (non-UTC) timestamps
- Graceful, explicit failure when opening encrypted Parquet files
- Stricter metadata validation: negative sizes, counts, and offsets are rejected, as are shredded Variant objects repeating a field across `typed_value` and `value`
- NaN-safe row group and page pruning for `float` and `double` columns
- Duplicate map keys resolve to the last value per the Parquet spec; `head()` with a filter caps matched rows rather than scanned rows
- `S3Source` factory methods return `S3InputFile`; the parquet-java compatibility layer tracks parquet-java 1.17.1
- API change reports are now published alongside the JavaDoc on the website

## 1.0.0.CR1 (2026-05-31)

[Announcement blog post](https://www.morling.dev/blog/improved-column-reader-api-geospatial-support-hardwood-1-0-0-cr1-available/) · [API changes](/api-changes/1.0.0.CR1/)

Highlights of this release:

- **Breaking:** `ColumnReader` rebuilt around a layer model, with per-layer validity, offsets, and real-item-only sizing for nested data (see the [Layer Model](how-to/column-reader.md#reading-nested-data-the-layer-model) docs); `ColumnReader` is now marked `@Experimental`
- More performant evaluation of multi-column filter expressions
- Split-aware reading via `RowGroupPredicate.byteRange(...)`, for Hadoop-style split integrations
- Coordinated multi-column reads via `ColumnReaders.nextBatch()` / `getRecordCount()`
- Richer `RowReader` value model: by-index field access on `PqStruct`, key-based lookup and typed accessors on `PqMap`, typed `List` accessors on `PqList`, and additional variant accessors
- Float16 logical type support (readable values and filter predicates) and recognition of the `NullType` logical annotation
- First-cut geospatial support (GEOMETRY/GEOGRAPHY logical types and bounding-box metadata)
- Reading of local files larger than 2 GB
- CLI: exhaustive logical-type formatting; `hardwood dive`: faster navigation of large collections and corrected "go to latest" in the data preview

See the [1.0.0.CR1 milestone](https://github.com/hardwood-hq/hardwood/milestone/6?closed=1) on GitHub for the full list of resolved issues.

## 1.0.0.Beta2 (2026-04-29)

[Announcement blog post](https://www.morling.dev/blog/variant-support-interactive-parquet-file-tui-hardwood-1.0.0.beta2-is-out/) · [API changes](/api-changes/1.0.0.Beta2/)

Highlights of this release:

- Interactive `hardwood dive` TUI for exploring Parquet files
- Parquet Variant logical type, including shredded reassembly
- Additional logical types: INTERVAL, MAP/LIST, INT96 timestamps
- Faster reads via a parallel per-column pipeline and per-column in-page row skipping

- Unified reader API based on builders
- CLI with reorganized `inspect` subcommands
